# Building Your Birthright

You may not know it, but you were born to be a hero. Each aspect of your life up to this point has shaped you into the adventurer you are today.
Starting from the very beginning, your birth, the community who raised you, the child you were.

The 'Birthright' part of character creation consists of three core pillars:

- Your physical appearance as informed by your species
- Your mental aptitudes as informed by the social conventions in your community, or innate psychic powers
- Your

## Physical
> These are physical traits that most of the species are born with in the default setting. 
> These traits can be removed as you wish.
> Mixed species can choose to look entirely like one parent or take the Dominant features from one species and the Subdominant features from the other
 
## Mental
> This is the general mental aspects of a species in the default setting. If you grew up raised by another species you may take features from that species instead
> Dominant/Subdominant rules apply here too and a background of over 3 or more different species only gains features from 2 (Or work with your DM to suggest appropriate swaps of the same level)

### Affinity
Affinity is a creature's innate connection to the world.

Most species are fantastical and will tend to have two or more affinities.
These can be both a blessing and a curse, as they simply mean more or less effects may apply to you (both positive and negative)

**Possible Affinities:**

***Worldly Affinities***
- Civilization 
- Nature
- Undeath
- Order
- Chaos

***Elemental Affinities***
- Fire
- Wood
- Metal
- Air
- Earth



## Culture
> This is the general culture of a species in the default setting. Someone raised in this culture likely learned these skills.
> Culture is a lot more localized than Mental features. A different tribe or band could have completely different cultures. Play around?
> These can be switched with other species similar to the Mental features. In addition, there are several generic cultures you could choose.


# Templates

Templates are generally changes to existing characters with established backgrounds. As such, most things stay the same, but there are some key changes
We recommend only using these for story reasons.
