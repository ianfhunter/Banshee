# Terrain Types

Terrain is not without its hazards.


> Creatures with a size larger than one cell may have to handle multiple terrains. However, effects do not stack unless stated otherwise. 
>
> Having a larger size may have other difficulties or benefits as noted in the terrain's descriptions.
