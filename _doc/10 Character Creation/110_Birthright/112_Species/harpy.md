<!-- short description -->
The harpy is a half-human, half-bird creature. Taloned feet and winged arms give the beings a fearsome appearance and their human half is often no less grotesque. However, there are many recordings of Harpies that are attractive to the eye, Notably these tend to be the ones which happen to become adventurers. Whether that be an innate attitude for the occupation, or a lower social barrier to overcome is unclear.
