<!-- short description -->
Selkies appear to be seals, but can shed their skin and change form into humans. Occasionally their aquan origins can be seen in their humanoid form - showing gills or webbed fingers. The skin of a Selkie is very valuable and without it, the Selkie cannot transform back.
