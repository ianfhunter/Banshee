<!-- short description -->
Centaurs are half-human, half-horse creatures. They have the body of a horse and the upper body of a human. There are various tales of how the centaur came to be; from a drunken incident between the nature gods, to a purposeful crafting of the perfect hunting form.

## Physical 

### Dimensions

Centaurs take up twice the amount of space that a human would, considering their much larger rear end.
Handheld items, spells and other manipulations are done with the front-facing half (A). 
A strong kick (see below) can be issued by their hind legs (B). smaller creatures (of a single cell size) may mount a centaur and sit at position (B). This follows the normal rules for [[Mounts]].
