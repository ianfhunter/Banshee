## Aura of Purity
Food and drink within 15ft of the priest are cleansed of basic diseases and poison. This includes, for example, sewer water.

## Shielder of the Weak
When someone is within 15ft of you and has lower health than you, you can grant them an additional +1 AC.

## Cleanse
You can use a reaction to try to remove a condition from an ally who just recieved a status effect. The difficulty is the same as if you had cast a restoration spell.

## Guarded Retreat
1/day, You can create an opportunity for other allies to retreat. They can move up to their full movement away from an enemy.

## Avatar of Defence
A spiritual set of armour wraps around your person, shielding you from threats, physical and not.

Once a day, you can resist one attack/spell that targets you. Any other effects of a spell still apply.
