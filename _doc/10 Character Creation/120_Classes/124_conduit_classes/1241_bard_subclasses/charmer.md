# Charmer

> Whether it be making snakes or bears dance, leading a procession of rats, or having a flock of birds dress you, The Charmer has a unique persuasion over animals - as long as they keep playing.

## Animal Direction
You can guide small beasts to follow you and do the following simple actions:
- Bring you a small item weighing 10 pounds or less
- Move to a location

## Frenzied Swarm
With enough creatures, a swarm can be made. It is difficult to stop, difficult to control and a force to be reckoned with. You can guide a swarm of small beasts to:
- Smash down a door
- Move *you* to a location
- Bring you an item weighing 30 pounds or less

## Symbiote
You can direct animals to be a literal extension of yourself, allowing you to:
- form a protective shell (+2 to AC)
- expand your weapon's reach (+5ft to Melee attacks)
- Increase your stride (+10 ft movement)

## Effortless Charm
You no longer need to be actively playing your instrument to charm creatures.
