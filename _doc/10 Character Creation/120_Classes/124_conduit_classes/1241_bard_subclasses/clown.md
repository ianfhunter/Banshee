# Fool

> Though you might be a clown on the outside, underneath is a real person. You might wear a fool's hat, a silly mask, or perhaps just a red honky nose. Your humour and levity often puts people at ease and diffuses situations

## Diffuse
Humor is often an antidote to serious and tense situations. By doing a brief performance, you have advantage on calming a group of people. Of course, if you have offended them beyond repair, no joke is good enough for this

## Hurtful Joke
You can use your Motivation dice to tell a humourous joke at someone else's expense. Roll with your power to hit and if it does, hurt that person an additional amount equal to your motivational dice roll. Someone nearby who finds it funny can heal an equal amount.

## Voice Actor
An expert at all routines, you can delay your voice, mimic others and "throw" it so it sounds as if it's on another side of a room.

## Jolly Disposition
Even when all things are looking bad, and all hope is lost. You can still crack a joke that gives just a little bit of life back to people.

You can bring someone back from the brink of death with 1 hit point 3/day
