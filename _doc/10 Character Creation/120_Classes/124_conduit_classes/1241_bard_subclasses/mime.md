## Illusiory Props
You can make several prop items out of force energy
- an endless rope
- a broom / rake / shovel

## Manifestation
After miming something for a minute, you are convincing enough that the object actually gains permenance and glows with a faint white outline.                                                  

## Illusiory Walls
You can make walls of force that are transparent but cannot be moved through. Spells can travel through these walls.

## Contagious Act
Your silence is infectious and you create a 15ft radius around yourself where no noise can be made.
