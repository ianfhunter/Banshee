# Priest

<!--
Notes: 
 - I think it is more interesting if less characters have access to restoration/resurrection spells. However, being forced to play healer is not fun, so they should be shared.

> Through faith or event, divine power is at your call

Note that though the text here refers to deities and gods, you do not need to ascribe to a particular religion. 

Some priests are not religious and others do not preach at all, having their own private spirituality.

## Class Features
### Source of Power
You are proficient with Knowledge (Religion).
Your channel power deals radiant damage.

### Prayer
At a time of rest, allies can heal twice as much.
This increases to 3x,4x,5x with tier increase.

### Focal Enemy
When attacking an **undead** creature, you gain advantage on your rolls - even if not directly using your power.

### Direct Line
Your power is such that you can commune directly with those who granted it. You may move your body and up to six others you are close to, to a parallel plane in which your deity resides.

## Making a Priest Subclass

As a general guideline, Priest subclasses should follow this basic form. Feel free to deviate from this if you so wish.

**Level 1**: A minor effect (Optional). Should be minimally game impacting.

**Level 2**: Base Ability. This should give the core flavour for the subclass

**Level 6**: Secondary Ability. This should build upon the theme granted from the previous ability

**Level 11**: Tertiary Ability. This can deviate away from the core class theme a bit

**Level 16**: Avatar. The priest becomes a direct channel of power from their god. This manifests itself in different ways, from embodying a god-like visage, to being able to call upon specific powers from their deity.
