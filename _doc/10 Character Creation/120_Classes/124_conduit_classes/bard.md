## Source of power
You know two families of instruments OR `art` tagged tools.

You must be weilding an instrument to channel magic through it. (TODO: Vocals? Cannot be disarmed)

## Motivate

At each tier, you gain a higher level of dice which you can freely give to another player on your turn.

They may add this dice to an attack or defence roll.

| Tier | Dice Size |
| 1 | d6 |
| 2 | d8 |
| 3 | d10 |
| 4 | d12 |

## Fame & Glory
Your name is known throughout the land and just speaking it can strike fear or hope into someone.

1/day you may strike fear (disadvantage on attacks) or hope (advantage on attacks) to a character you have met for the first time.
