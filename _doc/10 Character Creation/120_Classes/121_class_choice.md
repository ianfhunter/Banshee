# Facing the World

Your class may be your occupation, your defining skills, or more generally your approach to interacting with the world.

## Pick a Class

There are a few over-arching ways that one can draw power.

**Combatant**: One who has trained in traditional fighting techniques
**Conduit**: One who is able to channel an exterior power, be that the magic of the earth, a divine investment or otherwise

To put it simply, this can be thought of also as "Magic" and "Weapons".

Each 'Class' derives either from one of these main archetypes. Though these classifications may appear to restrict characters from using both facilities, it is certainly possible for Combatant classes to use magic and for Conduit classes to use weapons.

**Combatant Classes**
- [[Assassin]], A sneaky opportunist
- [[Barbarian]], A primal force
- [[Commander]], A careful tactician

**Conduit Classes**
- [[Bard]], Draws power through music and stirring speech
- [[Priest]]: Draws power through a faith
- [[Wizard]]: Can use magic through intense study
- [[Sorceror]]: Can use magic through natural ability

## Pick A Subclass

Within each class are more fine-grain selections that better define your character. Choose one of these also.

## Advanced Material

### Levels beyond 20

We don't encourage levels beyond 20, but if you wish to, alternate between Feats, Boons and Subclass/Class Power Increases. Be sure to make your enemies harder to compensate!

### Level 0

For Level 0 characters, we recommend that players use NPC stats and control a bunch of them through your starting adventures. The ones who survive gain a level and come into their powers.
