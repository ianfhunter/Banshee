# Facing the World

Your class may be your occupation, your defining skills, or more generally your approach to interacting with the world.

## Pick a Class

There are a few over-arching ways that one can draw power.

**Combatant**: One who has trained in traditional fighting techniques
**Conduit**: One who is able to channel an exterior power, be that the magic of the earth, a divine investment or otherwise

To put it simply, this can be thought of also as "Magic" and "Weapons".

Each 'Class' derives either from one of these main archetypes. Though these classifications may appear to restrict characters from using both facilities, it is certainly possible for Combatant classes to use magic and for Conduit classes to use weapons.

**Combatant Classes**
- [[Assassin]], A sneaky opportunist
- [[Barbarian]], A primal force
- [[Commander]], A careful tactician

**Conduit Classes**
- [[Bard]], Draws power through music and stirring speech
- [[Priest]]: Draws power through a faith
- [[Wizard]]: Can use magic through intense study
- [[Sorceror]]: Can use magic through natural ability

## Pick A Subclass

Within each class are more fine-grain selections that better define your character. Choose one of these also.

## Advanced Material

### Multi-Classing
(TODO: Not currently allowed)

### Creating your own Class / Subclass

**Conduits**

In the first four levels, Conduits are expected to be up-and-coming adventurers. They are getting to grips with their skills and learning from real encounters.

Level 1:
- A Class Description
- Known Skills
- A Channeling Power
- Basic Spells

Level 2:
- Subclass Feature

Level 3:
- Spell Upgrade

Level 4:
- Feat

In the next five levels, Conduits have settled into their powers and are beginning to push their limits, exploring new abilities and have a larger effect on the world.

Level 5:
- Power Increase

Level 6:
- Subclass Feature

Level 7:
- Channeling Power

Level 8:
- Spell Upgrade

Level 9:
- Boon. This may be something physical like a fort, or a powerful ally. These boons may be shared amongst the party.


The conduit now is a real force to be reckoned with. Word spreads of their power. This might be a good thing or a bad thing depending on their reputation and attitude. Requests for magic outside their usual ability start to appear - whether it be possible for the conduit to do them or not.

Level 10:
- Power Increase

Level 11:
- Subclass Feature

Level 12:
- Spell Upgrade

Level 13:
- Channeling Power

Level 14:
- Feat

Only a handful of people have the level of power that the conduit wields now. With great power comes great responsibility and the morality of an adventurer may truly be tested

Level 15:
- Power Increase

Level 16:
- Subclass Feature

Level 17:
- Boon

Level 18:
- Channeling Power

Level 19:
- Power Increase

Finally, the adventurer has reached their zenith. They are almost unparalleled in their connection to their power source.

Level 20:
- Subclass Feature


## Levels beyond 20

We don't encourage levels beyond 20, but if you wish to, alternate between Feats, Boons and Power Increases. Be sure to make your enemies harder to compensate!

## Level 0

For Level 0 characters, we recommend that players use NPC stats and control a bunch of them through your starting adventures. The ones who survive gain a level and come into their powers.
