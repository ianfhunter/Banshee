# Vital Statistics

## Ability Scores

Like other popular RPGs, BansheeRPG uses six statistics to represent your character's attributes.

- **Constitution (CON)**
- **Dexterity (DEX)**
- **Strength (STR)**
- **Wisdom (WIS)**
- **Intelligence (INT)**
- **Charisma (CHA)**

The average Joe or Jolene has a score of 0 for each of these attributes. The lowest a score can go is -5, at which you are lacking that ability in so much capacity that you are not able to stay alive. The highest a score usually can go is 5, but there are some strong monsters and magic items that can exceed this limit.
