# Movement

By default, a creature can move two units. These units might be a square or hex on a battlemap.

# Taking and Recieving Damage

Using your weapon, roll the damage dice. If the score is zero or below, it has missed. If the score is above zero, it has hit and the enemy should apply its damage

Note: There are no mechanics for critical hits/misses at present

If you recieve damage that makes you go below zero health, you are unconscious and are unable to fight until healed or a half hour passes in a safe location.
