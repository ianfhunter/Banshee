# Levelling

There are 5 Tiers of play. These tiers seperate local heroes from planar saviours.
Within these tiers, there are 5 Levels.
Each time a level up occurs, players may choose one of the following. They may not choose an option twice within the same tier and special rules apply to the 1at and 0th levels as described afterwards.

- Class Features
- Subclass Features
- Story Features
- Training Features
- Assistant Features

## 0th Level
*This is an optional level, not recommended for beginners.*
You have no competencies aside from those you have from your pre-adventuring career (e.g. a local ranger might know the bow, an onion farmer might know how to dig with a shovel, but he has likely not used it as a weapon before)

## 1st Level
You must choose Class Features as your first choice.
