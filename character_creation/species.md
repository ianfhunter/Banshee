# How it works

Building your background is a multi-step process 

- Species: Physical
> These are physical traits that most of the species are born with in the default setting. 
> These traits can be removed as you wish.
> Mixed species can choose to look entirely like one parent or take the Dominant features from one species and the Subdominant features from the other
 
- Species: Mental
> This is the general mental aspects of a species in the default setting. If you grew up raised by another species you may take features from that species instead
> Dominant/Subdominant rules apply here too and a background of over 3 or more different species only gains features from 2 (Or work with your DM to suggest appropriate swaps of the same level)

- Species: Culture
> This is the general culture of a species in the default setting. Someone raised in this culture likely learned these skills.
> Culture is a lot more localized than Mental features. A different tribe or band could have completely different cultures. Play around?
> These can be switched with other species similar to the Mental features. In addition, there are several generic cultures you could choose.
